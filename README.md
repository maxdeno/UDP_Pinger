# UDP_Pinger
In this simple project, A UDP pinger server and UDP pinger client are created.

# üß®Objectives
‚Ä¢	Learn the basics of socket programming for UDP in Python.<br>
‚Ä¢	Learn how to send and receive datagram packets using UDP sockets.<br>
‚Ä¢	Learn how to set a proper socket timeout.<br>
‚Ä¢	Learn the Ping application and its usefulness in computing statistics such as packet loss rate.<br>

# The UDP pinger server 
  responds to the packets sent to by the client by producing a certain output, however only 30% of the packet
  are simulated to be lost.<br>
  The server sits in a infite loop whereby, it accepts all the packets from the client. However, only the packets that correspond to 
  the random number (n>=4) generated by the import module are capitalized and sent to the client.<br>

# The UDP pinger client
  ‚Ä¢	The client sends 10 pings to the server.<br>
  ‚Ä¢ waits up to one second for a reply.<br>
  ‚Ä¢ sends the ping message using UDP.<br>
  ‚Ä¢ prints the response message from server(sequence_number, send_time), if any.<br>
  ‚Ä¢ calculates and prints the round trip time (RTT), in seconds, of each packet, if server responses
   otherwise, print ‚ÄúRequest timed out‚Äù.
